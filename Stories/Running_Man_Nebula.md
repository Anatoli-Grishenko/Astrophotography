Sh 2-279 (alternatively designated S279 or Sharpless 279) is an HII region and bright nebulae that includes a reflection nebula located in the constellation Orion. It is the northernmost part of the asterism known as Orion's Sword, lying 0.6Â° north of the Orion Nebula. The reflection nebula embedded in Sh 2-279 is popularly known as the Running Man Nebula.[1][3] Sh 2-279[2] comprises three NGC nebulae, NGC 1973, NGC 1975, and NGC 1977[4] that are divided by darker nebulous regions. It also includes the open cluster NGC 1981. The brightest nebulosity, later listed as NGC 1977, was discovered by William Herschel in 1786. He catalogued it as "H V 30" and described "!! 42 Orionis and neb[ula]". The two smaller reflection nebulae were first noted by German astronomer Heinrich Louis d'Arrest, NGC 1973 in 1862 and NGC 1975 in 1864.[5] All three were included in the New General Catalogue in 1888.[6] The designation NGC 1977 is used in various sources for the reflection area around 42 Orionis (the south-east portion of the reflection nebula), for the entire reflection nebula (including NGC 1973 and NGC 1975), or for the whole nebula complex.[5]
