## The end of a "small star"

The core of the star continue fusioning elements and increasing the temperature
But small stars do not have enough power to increase the temperature permanently and burn these atoms of carbon (C ), more Oxygen (O) and and, eventually, more Nitrogen (N), so the star starts to accumulate these "ashes" within its core.

Then, when our "small star" runs out of fuel (H + He) it collapses into a white dwarf star, explodes and expels the remaining elements to the sourronding cloud

And this happens, again and again, enriching the sourrounding cloud with new clouds of brand new elements.

Eventually, these new atoms might be hit by high-energy particles coming from their own star, or another close stars, they transform into lithium (Li) and berilium (Be), these are not part of the nucleosynthesis process, but a side effect ot it.

## The end of a "large star"

Depending on the mass of the mother molecular cloud, larger stars may also form, by collapsing higher 	quantities of hydrogen

adding more and more matter to the core, increasing the temperature and producing the same fusion process than in "small stars" seen above.

Stars continue "burning" hydrogen, helium, carbon, nytrogen and oxygen and due to their much large mass and power, they also produce heavier elements, mainly neon (Ne),  magnesium (Mg), silicium (Si) and sulfur (S) but also aluminum (Al)

and the star becomes a [red giant star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_giant)

This process continues until it produces iron elements (Fe). So far, the fusion process is exothermic and generates more and more energy. However, fusion of iron elements (Fe) becomes and endothermic reaction, which require the addition of more energy, and this will not happen.

Therefore, although these large stars produce large amounts of iron and heavy elements, they cannot continue burning them and start accumulating them in the core. Therfore they end up runing out of burning elements and, as well as small stars  exploded, these large stars also explode, but in a different manner, in one of the most intense energy events known in the universe

This explosion is knwon as a *Supernova*, and it produces gold (Au) and uranium (U) and a shock wave which reaches all these elements transforming them into sodium (Na), Borum (B), phosphorus (P), chlorus (Cl). The old core of the star collapses into what is known as a black hole.

This shock wave also reaches the whole molecular cloud and produces further gravitational collapses and the birth of new stars in an endless process that produces the remaining elements present in nature. This cycle of creation, death and re-creation of stars in what is known as a *star nursery*.


## The ashes after the explosions of stars

Both small stars and large stars end their lifes soaking all the sourrounding cloud with brand new elements, both light and heavy. With the coming of more ages, these elements will also collapse in the form of planets, as we know in our own solar system.

So, our little planet, this [pale blue dot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_Blue_Dot) with its nickel (Ni) and iron (Fe) melted core is the result of an uncountable sequence of supernovas, blended in a unique proportion of elements, collapsed into an sphere of matter, leveled by gravity and partially cooled, only in its crust. With more thousand centuries to come, these simple elements started to combine into more and more complex molecules like these

and they end up forming a very, very complex molecule, known as DNA, with a unique distinguishing feature: it can replicate itself and produce an exact copy of it.

Even the heavier elements, like iron (Fe), were able tro combine into some special molecules like this one,

![](Pics/hemoglobine.jpg)
(imamge source [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin))

a molecule whose constituents elements, hydrogen (H), carbon (C ), oxygen (O), nytrogen (N) billions and billions of years ago, where tranasformed by the many subsequent ancient stars, and evenmore, in whose heart lies an atom of the heavy iron (Fe). This molecule is known as hemoglobine, it lies inside our red blood cells and it allows us to breath oxygen, specially thanks to its iron (Fe) core, which a very very long time ago, was produced in a remote giant red star (as [Betelgeuse](Betelgeuse_Star.md)), as red as our red blood cells.	As Carl Sagan said in his book Cosmos, "we, the human kind,  are what simple hydrogen elements can produce with the pass of 15800 millions years".
