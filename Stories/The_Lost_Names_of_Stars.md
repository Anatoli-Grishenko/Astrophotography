# The lost names of stars

(Preliminary **DRAFT**) 

Most of the stars known today have a name in any of the many catalogues of clestial bodies like HD 8890, HR 424, SAO 308, HIP 11767, or TYC 4628-237-1. Names, indeed, very little romantic for a couple in love during a summer night. However, many of them, the most brightful ones, have other "more natural names" easier to remember. All of the names before refer to the same star, a very relevant star for astrophotographers, mainly those (almost all) with an equatorial mount. This particular star was named, since the middle ages, as "stella polaris" due be the fact that it was commonly used to point to the north terrestrial pole. We know it as Polaris. Way easier to remember. 

However there are other relevant stars that were very well knonwn in ancient times, as old as 3.000 years B.C., named [Sopdet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sopdet) for the Egyptians, [𒀯𒆕𒋛𒁲(KAK.SI.SÁ)](https://xing.fmi.uni-jena.de/mediawiki/index.php/KAK.SI.SA2) for the Sumerians in Babylon, or [Tishtrya](https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/tistrya-2/) for the Persians, or Σείριος (Seirios) for the greeks or [Sirius](./Sirius_Star.md) in modern astronomy, the brightest star in the sky.

Although these two stars have greek or latin names many of these ancient stars have arabic names like the poetic name given to the beautiful [Vega](./Vega_Star.md), known as "Wega" or "Waqi": النّسر الْواقع (an-nasr al-wāqi'), literally, "the eagle that falls from the sky". Due to bad translations along the history, some of them have reached us just as bad transliteratoins of the original ones.

## Stars with arcaic names

These are some of the most well known stars in the northern skies used by astrophotographers as celestial breadcrumbs that signal the invisible path between our night targets.

## The long journey: Babylon, Persia, Greece, Al-Andalus, Europe

The names of the stars, and other celestial bodies, date back to several thousand years B.C., almost simultaneously in civilizations like the Mayas and Babylon, although only the last one, in Mesopotamia (actual Irak), had influence in Ptolemy, with his [Almagest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almagest), and then to Europe (after several centuries) and then to modern astronomy.

Sumerians (2,000 B.C.) studied the night skies not as a vision of the universe, not even for orientation, but for predicting the future, as omens, for the sake of the families who ruled their kingdom. Just as superstition or as timed event that predicted the arrival of seassons.

One of these first observations is the path followed by the sun, the moon and other bodies like Venus or Jupiter in the table [Enuma Anu Enlil (𒌓𒀭𒈾𒀭𒂗𒆤𒇲)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enuma_Anu_Enlil), "The path of the the God Enlil (God of Winds and Storm)". 

![](./Pics/Enlil.jpg) 


The strength of Enlil was associated to the observations of Jupiter, as the most powerful light in the night sky, who followed the same path than the Sun. The Babylon God Enlil was adopted as Baal for the phoenicians, who devoted a mountain (Ball Zephon) and a temple for his worship near Beirut (Lebanon). This mountain is recorded the Book of Exodus in the Bible: "Now the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, "Tell the sons of Israel to turn back and camp before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea; you shall camp in front of Baal-zephon, opposite it, by the sea" Exodus:14-4 Nowadays, this very same location hosts the remainings of a Roman Temple devoted to ... of course a [Temple devoted to Jupiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Jupiter_(Baalbek)).

Indeed Babylonians already knew the God Sin, associated to the Moon, also followed that very same path.

 Or the [Table of Ammisaduqa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_tablet_of_Ammisaduqa) that describes the full astronomical record of the positions of Venus, which, interestingly, happens in similar dates, with the same target (Venus) right at the other side of the Earth, in central America during the [Maya civilization](./PaleoAstronomy.md).  The Babylonian God associated with Venus was the head of all the Gods, Ishtar. The following carving shows Ishtar (left) with Sin (center) and Shamash (right) the God associated to the Sun.

In summary, this celestial path is no other than the [Ecliptic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecliptic).

 Indeed, the babylonians used a system known as "The 36 stars" a division of the full sky into 36 areas, each of 10º of size, hence their name as "The Decans".

![](./Pics/Ecliptic3.jpg)
Another summerian table, in cuneiform writing, the [Mul.Apin (𒀯𒀳)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUL.APIN) also described the orbits of the remaining planets known: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. In order to recognize the patterns of stars along the ecliptic,  these 36 regions where grouped into 12 clusters of stars by assigning them supposed shapes and missions so they were more easily remembered and recognizable. The very 12 signs of the Zodiac which represent the path of Enlil (Jupiter) along the sky.

And, in the centuries to come, many more regions with supposed shapes too, were added: the birth of our current constellations.

These treaties must be considered very carefully, since, although they are dated several thousand years back, they show the first systematization of the skies, with a profound knowledge of the difference between stars and planets, precursor of later stellar maps and tables, with a huge influence on later studies on astronomy. 

Indeed, the babylonian knowledge about the position and movement of celestial bodies was adopted by the Persian empire when the Persian King Ciro the Great conquered Babylon. Indeed, the Persians used four of these stars to signal the fourth cardinal points during their nightly travels through the dessert. These [four stars](./PaleoAstronomy.md) where known as [Haftorang](https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/haftorang/?highlight=haftorang) ([Arcturus](./Arcturus_Star.md)), Venant ([Regulus](./Regulus_Star.md)), Satevis ([Antares](./Antares_Star.md)) and Tascheter ([Aldebaran](./Aldebaran_Star.md))
